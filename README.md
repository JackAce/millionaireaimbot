A C# application used to auto-respond to Who Wants to Be a Millionaire's "Ask the Audience Lifeline" questions, aksed over AOL Instant Messenger in 2005-2006.

This application requires the Trillian Instant Messenger client and the AutoIt automation program.

Keep in mind that this was originally written for .NET 1.0, so there is no use of any of the modern features of the framework like generics, LINQ, etc.
